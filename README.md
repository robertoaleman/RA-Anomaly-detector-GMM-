# RA Anomaly detector GMM v 1.0.2025
Anomaly detector in encrypted strings based on the Gaussian Mixture Model
Author: Roberto Aleman, ventics.com

The main idea behind using GMMs for anomaly detection is to model the distribution of "normal" data using a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Once this model is trained, data points with a low probability of being generated by any of the Gaussian components of the mixture are considered anomalous.

What Constitutes an Anomaly in This Context?

In the context of GMMs for anomaly detection, a data point is considered anomalous if:

# It lies in a region of feature space with a low probability density according to the trained GMM model. This means that the model, having learned the distribution of normal data, considers it highly unlikely that such a data point was generated by the normal process.

# It does not fit well with any of the individual Gaussian components of the mixture. If a data point falls far from the centers of all the Gaussians and has a significantly different variance, it will have a low probability of belonging to any of them.

# Scenario: Detecting anomalous patterns in encrypted character strings

#1. Training Data Collection and Preprocessing ("Normal" Cipher Strings)
# - We assume we have a set of encrypted strings that represent "normal" traffic or data.

encrypted_training_data = load_data("normal_encrypted_strings.txt")

# Function to extract features from an encrypted string
function extract_encrypted_features(string):
    features = {}
    features["length"] = length(string)

    # Calculate the frequency of each character (optional, may be computationally intensive)
    frequencies = {}
    for character in string:
        frequencies[character] = frequencies.get(character, 0) + 1
    features["character_frequencies"] = frequencies

    # Calculate the entropy of the string (optional)
    entropy = calculate_entropy(string)
    characteristics["entropy"] = entropy

    # Calculate the frequency of n-grams (e.g., bigrams) (optional, may be computationally intensive)
    bigram_frequencies = calculate_ngram_frequency(string, n=2)
    features["bigram_frequencies"] = bigram_frequencies

    return features

# Extract features from training chains
training_features = []
for string in encrypted_training_data:
    training_features.add(extract_encrypted_features(string))

# Convert features into numeric vectors for the GMM model
# This may involve flattening frequency dictionaries or using vector representations.
training_vectors = convert_features_to_vectors(training_features)

# Normalize or scale the feature vectors
normalized_training_vectors = normalize_data(training_vectors)

# 2. Selecting the Number of Gaussian Components (K)
# - Use a method such as BIC or AIC to estimate K.
K = 4 # Example

# 3. Training the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
gmm_model = gmm_initialize(n_components=K)
gmm_model = train_gmm(normalized_training_vectors, gmm_model)

# 4. Anomaly Detection in New Encrypted Chains
new_encrypted_strings = load_data("new_encrypted_strings.txt")

for new_string in new_encrypted_strings:
    # Extract features from the new string
    features_new_string = extract_encrypted_features(new_string)

    # Convert features to a numeric vector
    vector_new_string = convert_features_to_vector(features_new_string)

    # Normalize the feature vector using the same training parameters
    new_string_normalized_vector = normalize_data(new_string_vector, training_normalization_parameters)

    # Calculate the probability that the feature vector belongs to the GMM model
    probability = calculate_gmm_probability(normalized_new_string_vector, gmm_model)

    # 5. Definition of the Anomaly Threshold
    anomaly_threshold = 0.05 # Example

    # 6. Anomaly Marking
    if probability < anomaly_threshold:
        mark_as_anomalous(new_string, probability)
        generate_alert("Possible anomalous pattern detected in encrypted string: {}".format(new_string))
        register_anomaly(new_string, probability)
    else:
        mark_as_normal(new_string)
